            <h1>What is global warming ?</h1>
            <p>Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earthâ€™s average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released as people burn fossil fuels. The global average surface temperature rose 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.1 to 1.6Â° F) between 1906 and 2005, and the rate of temperature increase has nearly doubled in the last 50 years. Temperatures are certain to go up further.</p>

                        <h1>How Does Todayâ€™s Warming Compare to Past Climate Change?</h1>
                        <p>Earth has experienced climate change in the past without help from humanity. But the current climatic warming is occurring much more rapidly than past warming events.</p>

                        <h1>Why Do Scientists Think Current Warming Isnâ€™t Natural?</h1>
                        <p>In Earthâ€™s history before the Industrial Revolution, Earthâ€™s climate changed due to natural causes unrelated to human activity. These natural causes are still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades.</p>

                        <h1>How Much More Will Earth Warm?</h1>
                        <p>Models predict that as the world consumes ever more fossil fuel, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise, and Earthâ€™s average surface temperature will rise with them. Based on plausible emission scenarios, average surface temperatures could rise between 2Â°C and 6Â°C by the end of the 21st century. Some of this warming will occur even if future greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, because the Earth system has not yet fully adjusted to environmental changes we have already made.</p>

                        <h1>How Will Earth Respond to Warming Temperatures?</h1>
                        <p>The impact of global warming is far greater than just increasing temperatures. Warming modifies rainfall patterns, amplifies coastal erosion, lengthens the growing season in some regions, melts ice caps and glaciers, and alters the ranges of some infectious diseases. Some of these changes are already occurring.</p>
